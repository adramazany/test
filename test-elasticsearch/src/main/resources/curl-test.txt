  "lyrics": "Come all you rounders if you want to hear
The story of a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder's name....
Come all you rounders if you want to hear
The story of a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder's name
On the six-eight wheeler, boys, he won his fame
The caller called Casey at half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He mounted to the cabin with the orders in his hand
And he took his farewell trip to that promis'd land

Chorus:
Casey Jones--mounted to his cabin
Casey Jones--with his orders in his hand
Casey Jones--mounted to his cabin
And he took his... land"
